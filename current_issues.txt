problems:

Pause but cannot unpause

When window is open the game starts immediately but does not show lives until player hits start in menu

player can hit start while paused and it causes the lives to appear. 

alt-hot-keys do not work. Start and pause are set to ctrl-Q. It only shows the mneumonic for the start menu item. 


to-do: 

create bricks. 
lots more....
