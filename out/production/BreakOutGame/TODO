Have breaking bricks show you a +100 (or whatever the current point value of a brick breaking event is) at the location
of the destroyed brick. Score should float up and fade away rapidly so as not to cover up the playing field detrimentally.

Fiddle around with the ball absorbing momentum from the paddle

Attempt full-screen mode.

Make it so game pauses on death and has player hit "SPACE BAR" or something else when the player is ready to use the next
ball.

Make it so that getting a certain number of bricks without dying will increase the score multiplier from 1->2->3->...e.t.c.
up to a maximum of x5!

Have a level beaten without dying say "PERFECT"

Clean up code.

Introduce a double buffering system.

Create level system: using ascii text 30 deep by 15 wide. At most these can all be 1 (level 1 bricks), more than likely
000000000000000 1                   you will want blind spots. Can also have it so that a number other than 0 (no brick)
000000000000000 2                   and other than 1 will generate a brick with special properties (i.e. has more than
000000000000000 3                   one hit point or releases a second ball, powerup e.t.c..)
